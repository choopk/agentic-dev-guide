Generate Research Report

Create a comprehensive research report for a specific component, feature, or system area. This command uses the research agent to analyze the codebase and produce a structured research file that provides context for future development work.

Usage:
- Specify the feature/component name to research
- Agent will analyze relevant files and create structured report
- Output saved to `.claude/research-reports/[feature-name].md`

The research report will include:
- Component usage flows with file:line references  
- Architecture overview and key integration points
- Code references for core files and functions
- Testing coverage status
- Dependencies and patterns
- Important gotchas and next steps
